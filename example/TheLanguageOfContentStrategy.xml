  <title>The Language of Content Strategy</title>
  <section>
    <title>Core Concepts</title>
    <abstract>
      <p>This section covers the foundational terms that underpin the
        discipline of content strategy. These concepts become the shot
        of thread that strengthens the fabric of work built upon it.
        Understanding these concepts and their importance enhances the
        understanding of the entire lexicon and of the work before us as
        practitioners.</p>

    <title>Core Deliverables</title>
    <abstract>
      <p>Content strategy projects can take on many forms, to solve a
        great range of business problems. At the heart of the practice,
        however, are some common project deliverables. These are by no
        means an absolute set of deliverables, but they are some of the
        most common ones. These deliverables create a baseline
        understanding of the content in a project: the current state,
        the desired outcomes, and the analyses done to discover
        gaps.</p>
